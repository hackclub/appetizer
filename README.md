# Appetizer

> Originally created by [Fantamomo](https://github.com/Fantamomo) as [app-approver](https://github.com/Fantamomo/app-approver).

This is a Slack bot that handles the request approval process for a Slack organization.

## Installation

Create a new Slack app using the [`manifest.json`](manifest.json), disable Socket Mode and read [HTTP API](#http-api) for more information.

Then install the app to your **Slack Enterprise Organization**, not to a single workspace. You need to be an organization admin/owner.

We recommend using a new admin account for this, so that all actions are performed under this account. And not yours.

Start the program. On the first run, it will automatically generate a `config.properties` file containing all available configuration options.

### Configuration

The configuration file can be specified using the `CONFIG_FILE_PATH` environment variable. If it is not set, `config.properties` in the current working directory is used.

### Running with Docker & Docker Compose

#### Using Docker Compose (Recommended)

1. Copy the sample environment file and fill in your Slack and database credentials:
   ```bash
   cp .env.example .env
   ```
2. Build and start the bot and PostgreSQL services:
   ```bash
   docker compose up -d
   ```

#### Using Docker directly

1. Build the Docker image:
   ```bash
   docker build -t bot-approver .
   ```
2. Run the container:
   ```bash
   docker run -d \
     --name bot-approver \
     -p 80:80 \
     -e POSTGRES_URL="r2dbc:postgresql://host.docker.internal:5432/bot_approver" \
     -e POSTGRES_USER="bot_approver" \
     -e POSTGRES_PASSWORD="secretpassword" \
     -e SLACK_BOT_TOKEN="xoxb-..." \
     -e SLACK_USER_TOKEN="xoxp-..." \
     -e SLACK_CHANNEL_REVIEW="C12345678" \
     -e SLACK_CHANNEL_LOG="C87654321" \
     bot-approver
   ```

### Managing restrictions and team members

Restrictions and team members can be managed with the `/app-approver` command. To execute the command, your user id must be in the `admin.users` list.

#### Scopes

| Command                                      | Description                                     |
|----------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------|
| `scopes`                                     | Lists the current restricted/allowed scopes     |
| `scopes allow <scope> [type]`                | Allows a scope for verified users               |
| `scopes allow-unverified <scope> [type]`     | Allows a scope even for unverified users        |
| `scopes restrict <scope> [type] [review]`    | Restricts a scope                               |
| `scopes reset <scope> [type]`                | Removes the configuration of a scope            |

**Arguments**

- `<scope>`: The scope to match
  - Can be the scope itself, to match only it, e.g.: `chat:write`
  - But can also be a pattern like `admin.*` to match all scopes starting with `admin.` or `*:read` to match all scopes ending with `:read`
  - If it starts with `/` we will remove the `/` and interpret the rest as a regex pattern.
  - Note: The matching also has specificity. That means if you disallow all `chat:*`, and then allow `chat:write`. The `chat:write` will be allowed because it is more specific.
  - Only `*` means all scopes. (And has the lowest specificity)
- `[type]`: The type of the scope.
  - `BOT`: Only bot scopes.
  - `USER`: Only user scopes.
  - `BOTH`: Both user and bot scopes.
- `[review]`: Whether the scope should be reviewed by an admin.
  - `true`: The scope should be reviewed, and thus will be forwarded to the team
  - `false`: The scope will instantly be denied.
  - This can only be used with `scopes restrict`

**Behavior**

- `allow`: Allows the scope for verified users. Is the default. So you only need to specify this if you restricted a pattern in which the scope would be rejected.
- `allow-unverified`: Allows the scope for unverified users.
- `restrict`: Restricts the scope for all users.
- `reset`: Removes the scope from the database. Leaving type out or using `BOTH` ignores the type and removes all entries for the scope.

#### Team Members

| Command                | Description                    |
|------------------------|--------------------------------|
| `team`                 | Shows all team members         |
| `team add <user>`      | Adds a user to the team        |
| `team remove <user>`   | Removes a user from the team   |

`<user>` can be a user id like `U0123456789` or a mention like `@user`.

Team members can review requests (approve, deny, restrict and undo). They are not allowed to use the slash command, only the configuration admins.

### HTTP API

Slack events are received through the HTTP endpoint:

```text
/slack/events
```

Set in your Slack app the **Request URL** to `<your-domain>/slack/events`, do the same for Interactions.

> We do theoretically support Socket Mode, but we do not recommend it, as it was only implemented for development purposes and not tested in production.

## Approval Flow

When a request is received, the bot checks the following to determinate if the request is valid and should be approved or rejected.

1. **Restricted**: If the application is restricted, the request is <u>rejected</u>.
2. **Enterprise Installation**: If the request is for the entier org, the request is <u>rejected</u>.
3. **Previous denied request**: If the request was previously denied, and nothing changed, the request is also <u>rejected</u>. (Do avoid spam)
4. **Scope evaluation**: All the scopes are checked against the restricted scopes:
    - If there is any no reviewable scope, the request is <u>rejected</u>.
    - If there is any reviewable scope, the request needs to be <u>manually reviewed</u>.
    - If the user is **not** verified and the request does not only contain scopes that are **allowed** for **unverified users**, the request is <u>rejected</u>.
5. **Previous approved scopes**: But hold on, let's review the previous approved scopes first. (Only relevant if the app has been approved before)
    - If the previous approved scopes contained any restricted scopes, and this request does not add any **new** restricted scopes, the request is <u>approved</u>.
    - If this request adds any new restricted scopes, the request is <u>rejected</u> or <u>reviewed</u> within the **above rules**.

## Rejecting

I talked a lot about rejecting requests above. Actually, the request is not rejected, we mark it like that, but on the slack side, it is still pending review.  

This is used because of how slack works:  
When a member requests an app, a request is created with the pending status.    
If we automatically approve it, we tell Slack that it is approved.  
But if the automation rejects it, we don't tell slack that it is rejected. This is necessary to allow the team to override the decision.

**New Problem**: A user cannot send a new request if they have a pending request. So there is a button to withdraw the request, which cancels the request on Slack's side, so the user can send a new request.

But there is also a **Request Manual Review** button, which only changes our status to pending review and updates the thread.

**That's the reason why we don't directly tell slack that the request is rejected.**

## Reviewing

Every request that is sent creates a new thread in the review channel, even if it is rejected or approved automatically.

The reason behind this is to allow the reviewer to override the automation decision. Also, in the thread all the actions are visible.

## Restricting

The review team can restrict an app. That means that the app can never be requested again. Slack will block every try to install it again.

> Only use this if absolutely necessary. (You can still undo it later)

## Status

The status of your requests can be viewed in the App Home of the installed app if you are not a team member.
If you are a team member, you can view all pending requests in the App Home and the last decisions made.

The Bot also DMs the user about the status of their request. And why it was rejected.

There is also a public LOG channel where all requests are logged.
